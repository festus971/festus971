    <hi> The Pine threes of the world.</hi>
    <h2> Featuring kijabe </h2>
<p class="artcle summary">
    pine trees belong to a familly of trees called <strong> conifer</strong>
</p>  
<h2> Geographical Distribution</h2>
<p id="pine">
    Most regions of the northern hemisphere host some native species of pine. <a class="note"href:="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pine">More info</a>. This doesn't mean that pine trees do not grow in the southern hemisphere. <br>
    Take <em>Kijabe</em> for  example
</p>  
<h2> Why kijabe</h2>
<p> Kijabe is in the southern hemisphere, but has a diverse population of pin trees.</p>
<h4> Is this weird?</h4>
<p class="short note"> Not exactly</p>
<p class="article"> Weird explanation: Geographically speaking, the eart rotates on a tilted axis, which means that for almost half of the day, kijabe is in the Northern hemisphere (at least if we consider the cosmic plane).

</p>
<p>
    Really though, we started by saying that <a href="#pine"> Most pine grow on the Northern hemisphere</a>. But does not mean that no pine grow in the southern hemisphere.
